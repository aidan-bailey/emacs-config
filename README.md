# PersonalEmacsConfig
My personal emacs setup for multi-language code-editing (and note taking!)

## Install
There are two ways one can make use of this configuration.

### Fresh Install
Copy *init.el*, *modules*, and *extras* into your local .emacs.d.
Once you restart Emacs, use-package will install all package dependencies.

### Pre-Compiled
Simply clone this directory into your local .emacs.d.
