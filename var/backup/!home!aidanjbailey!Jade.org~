* The Godfather
  When I was a kid, the only source of enjoyment I got from this movie was when Marlon Brando's
  Don Corleone was gracing the screen. This, however, was enough to make me to watch it many many
  of times.
* Fight Club
  I didn't enjoy this movie as much as some other people. Cannot be disputed it's one of the most
  well written movies ever made with David Fincher displaying his regular amazing fast-cut directing
  style.
* Inception
  This movie is long and most of the enjoyment comes from thinking you're as smart as Christopher Nolan
  when you learn an inch of the actual plot.
