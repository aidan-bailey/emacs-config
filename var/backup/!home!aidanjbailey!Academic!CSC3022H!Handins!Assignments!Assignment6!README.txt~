Hello Tutor.

BUILD:

Simply type "make" in the project directory.

RUNNING:

For the base assignment, running the binary without args will produce the answer textfile as well as information stipulating
to the original test grid, however, since I thought this algorithm is very cool, I added some additional functionality.

SPECIAL FEATURES (MAZE MODE):

If you add 2 additional arguments:
./Assignment6 <x-val> <y-val>
A grid will be generatod
