* Sequential Logic
  
[[file:Sequential_Logic/2020-05-07_07-47-57_screenshot.png]]

A logic circuit whereby the output is not only based on the input signals, but also on the
sequence of past inputs.

** Types
*** Synchronous
    State changes in step with timing signal.
*** Asynchronous
    State changes whenever input changes.


** 1-Bit Storage Elements

   /Latches/ and /Flip-Flops/ store *state information*.

   1 Flip-Flop holds 1-bit of information.

*** SR-Latch
    
    *Duel Sets*: Set, Reset (hence the name)
