* Question 1
A.
  Application
  - Local DNS server is probed for hostname translation. 
  - Sends an HTTP request to transport layer.

  Transport
  - Sends a TCP connection request.
    
  Network
  - Using Internet Protocol as well as various routing protocols to determine the requests route to
    its destination.

  Data Link
  - Uses either Ehternet Protocol (if wired) or 802.11 Protocol (if wireless) to convert the request
    bit-by-bit into a format that can be delivered over the wire.

  Physical
  - Actualy transmits of signals over a medium.

B. 
If required, they are implemented into the Application layer.  

* Question 2
a) 
  * client-server
  * peer-to-peer

b)
data integrity

c)
  * Control: increase cwnd by 1 MSS every RTT until loss detected
  * Slow Start: double cwnd every RTT until loss is detected whereby it goes back to 1

d)
Transport Layer

e)
Star topology: So all UCTs traffic to the internet goes through the router.

f)
