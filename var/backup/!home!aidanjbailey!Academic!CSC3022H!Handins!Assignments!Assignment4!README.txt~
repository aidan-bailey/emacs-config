AIDAN's CLUSTERERERER README+~+~

Driver:
Contains main method and error throwing. Used to call on the KMeanHelper and PPMHelper classes.

PPMHelper:
Parses PPM files, storing their contents for easy reading and manipulation.

KMeanHelper:
Performs KMean algorithm on inputted ppmhelper images.

::USAGE::
cluster <dataset> <optional-flag-args> 

::REQUIRED::
<dataset>                        Directory location of ppm files.

::OPTIONAL::
-o <output_filename>             Name of the desired output file. (DEFAULT: std::cout)
-k <n>                           Number of clusters to be generated. (DEFAULT: 10)
-bin <b>                         Specifies the width of generated histograms. (DEFAULT: 1)
-colour                          Images retain their colour instead of converting to greyscale
-mean                            Use average distance determined centroid initialization opimization

::HELPFUL-NOTES::
+ The <dataset> argument can either be the name of a directory in the same directory as the
executable or simply an absolute/relative path to a directory anywhere on the system.
Wild cards can be used. The program will automatically operate on all files with a .ppm extension
found in the specified directory, no need to state them explicitly. This has been tried and tested
on linux but in theory should work on windows as well. Code was found and ammended from a
stackoverflow post. The link is commented in the code.
+ The "mean" flag doesn't necessarily these pictures rocognition more accurate, though it should for
a more diverse set of images.
